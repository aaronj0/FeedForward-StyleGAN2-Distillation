# FeedForward-StyleGAN2-Distillation
A feedforward image manipulation via distillation of StyleGAN2 architecture ensembled with pix2pixhd to encompass certain feature morphing capabilities via its latent variable mapping architecture such gender shift and varying the extents of attributes. Based on EvgenyKashins paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03581. This paired image-to-image translation, trained on synthetic data generated by StyleGAN2 outperforms existing approaches in image manipulation.
